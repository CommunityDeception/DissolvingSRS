# DissolvingSRS

This repository is about the implementation of the Incremental Social Instruments. The codes in this repository contains two main parts: social learning and edge creation. We adopt Q-learning as the social learning in the file *core/learning* and minimizing BA-ratio as the edge creation strategy in the file *core/strategy*. The file *entry.py* is the parameter setting interface.
